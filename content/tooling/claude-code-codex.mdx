Claude Code and GitHub Codex solve overlapping but distinct problems. Claude Code is a terminal-based agent that can read your codebase, run commands, and make changes across multiple files. Codex is GitHub-native — it lives in your repository and can respond to issues, review PRs, and make changes through the GitHub interface.

I use both, and they complement each other in ways that weren't obvious at first.

## Claude Code: what it's actually good at

Claude Code shines for tasks that require understanding a large codebase and making coordinated changes across multiple files. The key capability: it can read your entire codebase, understand the patterns and conventions, and make changes that are consistent with the existing code.

The patterns I use most:

**Codebase exploration.** "Explain how authentication works in this codebase" — Claude Code reads the relevant files and gives you a clear explanation. Faster than reading the code yourself for an unfamiliar codebase.

**Cross-file refactors.** "Rename this function everywhere it's used and update all the call sites." Claude Code handles the mechanical work; you review the diff.

**Adding features with existing patterns.** "Add a new API route that follows the same pattern as the existing routes." Claude Code reads the existing routes, understands the pattern, and implements the new one consistently.

**CLAUDE.md-driven development.** The `CLAUDE.md` file is how you give Claude Code persistent context about your project. Conventions, guardrails, things it should always or never do. This is the most underused feature — a good `CLAUDE.md` dramatically improves output quality.

## Codex: the GitHub-native workflow

Codex is different: it's triggered by GitHub events (issues, PR comments, mentions) and operates through the GitHub interface. The use cases are narrower but very useful:

**Issue-to-PR.** Assign an issue to Codex and it creates a branch, implements a fix, and opens a PR. Works well for well-defined, isolated issues.

**PR review.** Codex reviews PRs automatically and posts comments. Good for catching mechanical issues before human review.

**Responding to review comments.** Comment on a PR asking Codex to address a specific review comment. It makes the change and updates the PR.

## How they complement each other

I use Claude Code for complex, multi-step tasks that require deep codebase understanding. I use Codex for GitHub-integrated workflows — issue triage, PR review, responding to comments.

The combination: Claude Code for the hard implementation work, Codex for the GitHub workflow automation around it.
