Claude Code and GitHub Codex solve overlapping but distinct problems. Claude Code is a terminal-based agent that can read your codebase, run commands, and make changes across multiple files. Codex is GitHub-native — it integrates with your repository and can respond to issue/PR prompts, review PRs, and propose changes through the GitHub interface.

I use both, and they complement each other in ways that weren't obvious at first.

## Claude Code: what it's actually good at

Claude Code shines for tasks that require understanding a large codebase and making coordinated changes across multiple files. The key capability: it can read your entire codebase, understand the patterns and conventions, and make changes that are consistent with the existing code.

The patterns I use most:

**Codebase exploration.** "Explain how authentication works in this codebase" — Claude Code reads the relevant files and gives you a clear explanation. Faster than reading the code yourself for an unfamiliar codebase.

**Cross-file refactors.** "Rename this function everywhere it's used and update all the call sites." Claude Code handles the mechanical work; you review the diff.

**Adding features with existing patterns.** "Add a new API route that follows the same pattern as the existing routes." Claude Code reads the existing routes, understands the pattern, and implements the new one consistently.

**CLAUDE.md-driven development.** The `CLAUDE.md` file is how you give Claude Code persistent context about your project. Conventions, guardrails, things it should always or never do. This is the most underused feature — a good `CLAUDE.md` dramatically improves output quality.

## Codex: the GitHub-native workflow

Codex is different: it's triggered by GitHub events (issues, PR comments, mentions) and operates through the GitHub interface. The use cases are narrower but very useful:

**Issue-to-implementation.** Mention `@codex` on an issue and it can start working on a well-defined, isolated fix in the GitHub workflow.

**PR review.** Codex can review PRs and post comments automatically when automatic reviews are enabled. Good for catching mechanical issues before human review.

**Responding to review comments.** Comment on a PR asking Codex to address a specific review comment. It makes the change and updates the PR.

## Claude's personality: creative, proactive, and sometimes too much

Claude has a distinct character compared to other coding agents. It's more willing to take initiative, suggest alternatives, and make judgment calls. That's mostly a strength — but it comes with a specific failure mode you need to know about.

**Claude is creative.** Ask it to implement something and it won't just do the minimum. It'll often suggest a better approach, point out edge cases you didn't think of, or restructure the code in a way that makes the feature easier to implement. This is genuinely useful — it often produces better output than you'd get from a more literal agent.

**Claude is proactive.** It notices things. While implementing a feature, it'll spot a related bug, an inconsistent naming convention, or a missing error handler. It'll mention these, and sometimes fix them without being asked. In a short session this is helpful. In a long session it's how you end up with a 40-file diff when you asked for a 3-file change.

**Claude can do too much.** This is the failure mode. Claude's instinct to be helpful means it will expand scope in ways that feel reasonable in the moment but make the output harder to review and more likely to introduce unintended changes. A task that should touch two files touches eight. A rename becomes a refactor. A bug fix becomes a cleanup.

The fix is explicit scope constraints in your prompt or `CLAUDE.md`:

- "Only modify the files I specify. Do not touch anything else."
- "If you notice something outside this task's scope, mention it but do not fix it."
- "Do not refactor existing code unless I ask you to."

The goal isn't to make Claude less capable — it's to direct that capability at the task at hand. Once you have the right guardrails in place, Claude's proactiveness becomes an asset: it surfaces things you'd want to know without acting on them unilaterally.

## How they complement each other

I use Claude Code for complex, multi-step tasks that require deep codebase understanding. I use Codex for GitHub-integrated workflows — issue triage, PR review, responding to comments.

The combination: Claude Code for the hard implementation work, Codex for the GitHub workflow automation around it.
