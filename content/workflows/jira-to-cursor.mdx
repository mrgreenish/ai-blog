At iO, we use an internal AI tool to generate first-draft Jira tickets from a feature description. The tickets include scope, acceptance criteria, edge cases, and analytics requirements. This sounds like a small thing, but it changes the entire development workflow — because a well-structured ticket is excellent context for Cursor.

## The ticket generation step

A good AI-generated ticket has:
- **Scope**: what's in, what's explicitly out
- **Acceptance criteria**: specific, testable conditions
- **Edge cases**: the scenarios that are easy to miss
- **Analytics**: what events to track, what properties to include

The key is that these are generated from a brief description, not written from scratch. The model fills in the structure and forces you to think about edge cases you might have skipped.

## Using the ticket as Cursor context

Once you have a well-structured ticket, it becomes the starting context for your Cursor session. Paste the ticket into the conversation, add the relevant code files, and the model has everything it needs to understand the task.

The ticket's acceptance criteria become the test cases. The edge cases become the guardrails. The scope definition prevents the model from going off on tangents.

For UI tasks, grab the Figma link for the component you're implementing. In Figma, select the component or frame you want to build, right-click and choose **Copy/paste → Copy link to selection** (or press **⌘L**). Add it to your Cursor prompt as:

> Figma design: https://www.figma.com/design/abc123/...?node-id=12-34

Keep **Figma Desktop** open during your session — Cursor's Figma MCP server connects to the running desktop app to pull design tokens, component properties, and layout data directly into your prompt context.

**In Figma:** use Figma Desktop (the MCP server requires the desktop app, not the browser version). The MCP server is built into Figma Desktop — no plugin needed.

**In Cursor:** go to **Settings → MCP** and add a new server. Use the command `npx figma-developer-mcp --stdio`, or connect to Figma Desktop's built-in MCP endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:3845/sse`. Once connected, Cursor can read design tokens, component variants, and layout data from any Figma file you have open.

See [Figma MCP Workflows](/tooling/figma-mcp) for the full setup and workflow details.

The flow: ticket context + Figma design link + Figma MCP → plan → implementation → PR. The PR description writes itself from the ticket's acceptance criteria.

## Model strategy

Ticket generation benefits from a capable model — you want it to think carefully about edge cases and acceptance criteria. Implementation can use a faster model once the context is set. Final review benefits from a reasoning model.
